# Common-Drain TECMOS Fundamental Amplifier Simulator

The TECMOS CD Amplifier Simulator allows users to simulate the behavior of a TECMOS CD Amplifier circuit. A TECMOS CD Amplifier is a type of amplifier commonly used in electronic circuits for various applications, including audio amplification.

## Features

- **Simulation Parameters:** Users can adjust the amplitude and frequency of the input signal, as well as modify circuit parameters.
- **Performance Analysis:** The simulator calculates the performance of the DC stage of the amplifier, providing insights into its operational characteristics.
- **Graphical Output:** Graphs depicting the input signal, output signal, and voltage gate-source (Vgs) signal are generated, aiding in the visualization of circuit behavior.

## How to Run the Project

To run the TECMOS CD Amplifier Simulator, follow these simple steps:
1. **Prerequisites:**
   -  Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system. The simulator requires MATLAB to execute.
2. **Setup:**
   - Place all the files in the same directory on your computer.
3. **Execution:**
   - Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you have saved the project files
   - Run the 'main.m' script by entering the following command in the MATLAB command window:

```
     run("main.m")
```

4. **Interact with the Simulator:**
   - Once the "main.m" script is executed, the simulator interface will launch.
   - Adjust the input signal amplitude, frequency, and circuit parameters as desired.
   - Click on the appropriate buttons or input fields to initiate the simulation and view the results.
